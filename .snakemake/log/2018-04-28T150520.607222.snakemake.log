Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
Terminating processes on user request, this might take some time.
MissingOutputException in line 61 of /srv/gsfs0/projects/bhatt/fiona/bacteremia/strainsifter/Snakefile:
Missing files after 5 seconds:
passed_samples/S82.bam
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
