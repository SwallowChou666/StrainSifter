Building DAG of jobs...
Using shell: /usr/bin/bash
Provided cores: 1
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Unlimited resources: time, mem
Job counts:
	count	jobs

	2

rule call_snps:
    input: pileup/S82.pileup
    output: snp_calls/S82.tsv
    jobid: 1
    wildcards: sample=S82
    resources: mem=32, time=2

Finished job 1.
